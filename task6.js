
// Task 6: Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination,
//  "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

var nameI = 'Hira \n Hasan'
console.log(nameI)
var name2 = nameI.replace(/\n||\t/g, "")
console.log("name after removing whitespace:", name2)
