//Task 12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same,
// but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.



var names = ['Hira', 'Hasan','Talha',  'Iqra']

console.log(`Hello ${names[1]} great to meet you.`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[2]} great to meet you.`);
